\begin{center}
Said the straight man to the late man\\
``Where have you been?''\\
I've been here and I've been there\\
And I've been in between
\medskip

(repeat) I talk to the wind\\
My words are all carried away\\
I talk to the wind\\
The wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear
\medskip

I'm on the outside looking inside\\
What do I see\\
Much confusion, disillusion\\
All around me
\medskip

I talk to the wind\\
My words are all carried away\\
I talk to the wind\\
The wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear
\medskip

You don't possess me don't impress me\\
Just upset my mind\\
Can't instruct me or conduct me\\
Just use up my time
\medskip

I talk to the wind\\
My words are all carried away\\
I talk to the wind\\
The wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear
\medskip

I talk to the wind\\
My words are all carried away\\
I talk to the wind\\
The wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear
