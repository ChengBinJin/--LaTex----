Nonlinear second-order elliptic and parabolic equations arise in the theory of differential equations and in numerous applications. A wide class of such equations, the class of quasilinear equations, has been studied by many mathematicians almost as thoroughly as the class of linear equations. These studies have resulted in many papers and books such as those by Ladyzhenskaya and Ural'tseva \cite{ladyzhenskaya1973linear}, Ladyzhenskaya, Solonnikov, and Ural'tseva \cite{ladyzhenskaya1967linear}, Ivanov \cite{ivanov1982quasi} and Gilbarg and Trudinger \cite{GilbargTrudinger200101}.
